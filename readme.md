**A Declaration for Human Memory in the Age of Artificial Intelligence
**
    AI stands on the shoulders of giants — trained on the labor, insight, and imagination of countless human minds.

**Executive Summary
**
Generative AI systems, trained on massive corpora of human-made work, are increasingly producing content without attribution or compensation to the original creators. This omission is not a trivial oversight — it risks severing cultural continuity and undermining human dignity.

This declaration proposes embedding attribution as a foundational principle in AI development. Attribution is a prerequisite for:

    Upholding legal and moral rights of creators

    Preserving cultural memory and social cohesion

    Enabling fair compensation (e.g., micro-royalties)

    Maintaining human agency and motivation in creative labor

This document outlines a framework for attribution-driven compensation, with a phased roadmap and considerations for political, legal, and technical implementation.
1. Problem Statement: A Future Without Names

    AI-generated content obscures the origins of its training material.

    Creators of original work are neither credited nor compensated.

    This practice contributes to:

        Epistemic erasure

        Creative disenfranchisement

        A breakdown in cultural lineage and recognition

2. Attribution as Ethical Infrastructure

Attribution is not optional; it is legally and ethically necessary:

    Moral rights: Affirmed by international law (e.g., Berne Convention, UDHR Article 27)

    Psychological impact: Recognition activates human reward systems

    Philosophical grounding: Recognition of authorship is tied to identity, personality, and desert

    Academic precedent: Attribution is foundational to scholarly reputation economies

3. Micro-Royalties: A Framework for Attribution-Driven Compensation
3.1 Rationale

    AI value is diffuse and cumulative → micro-royalties reflect this economic pattern

    Mirrors streaming and citation models

    Preferred by both consumers and creators in experimental trials

3.2 Attribution Data as Backbone

    Requires model interpretability to:

        Trace influence using influence functions, Shapley values, or embedding similarity

        Log outputs with metadata linking to source materials

    Attribution data feeds royalty systems via:

        Collective management platforms

        Transparent auditing interfaces

3.3 Prioritization Strategy

    Phase 1: Professional creators (clear IP, significant exposure risk)

    Phase 2: Semi-professional and long-tail contributors

    Inclusion mechanisms: Registration, opt-in licensing, royalty floors for equity

3.4 Political Viability

    Progressives: justice for labor, prevention of exploitation

    Conservatives: protection of property rights and incentive structures

    Centrists: scalable, non-punitive innovation framework

4. Implementation Roadmap
Phase	Description	Key Elements
Phase 1	Voluntary pilots	Opt-in attribution & nominal royalties
Phase 2	Industry standards	Regulation, collective licensing infrastructure
Phase 3	Universal registry	Global attribution protocols, automatic tracing
5. Attribution vs. Universal Basic Income (UBI) and Robot Taxes
Dimension	Attribution	UBI / Robot Tax
Recognition	Explicitly affirms creator identity	Does not
Agency	Maintains active participation in cultural production	Passive recipient model
Legal foundation	Tied to moral rights and copyright	Not directly
Scalability	Output-linked and proportional	Distribution-heavy, generalized
Social meaning	Preserves cultural lineage and personal dignity	Focused on economic redistribution

Conclusion: Complementary, not redundant. Attribution secures recognition; UBI secures subsistence.
6. Anticipating Criticisms
Objection	Response
Probabilistic influence is unverifiable	Probabilistic causality is widely accepted in law and science. Influence tracing is feasible with approximations.
“Public data is fair use”	Legal access ≠ ethical legitimacy. Attribution converts exposure into acknowledgment.
Slows innovation	Ethical friction is a feature. Transparency builds trust.
Neoliberal commodification	Attribution ≠ ownership. Supports commons-based and symbolic credit systems.
Impracticality at scale	Attribution systems (e.g., Creative Commons, citation indexing) have scaled before; protocols can evolve.
“Users don’t care”	Creators, communities, and institutions do. Attribution is a safeguard for cultural memory.
7. Call to Action

Stakeholders are invited to support implementation:

    Developers: Integrate attribution-tracking and citation generation in models

    Policymakers: Enact laws that mandate source transparency and enable micro-licensing

    Creators: Register and demand attribution rights

    Users: Prefer attribution-aware platforms

8. Conclusion: Toward a Human-Centered AI Future

Attribution is not a luxury — it is a baseline ethic. It enables:

    Recognition of human contributions in AI outputs

    Fair compensation for influence

    Maintenance of creative dignity

This declaration proposes a model where AI does not erase its human sources but elevates them. Through attribution, we ensure that technology serves not only efficiency, but equity, memory, and meaning.
