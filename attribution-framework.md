AI Attribution Framework: Principles and Technical Foundations
1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines the ethical, technical, and operational principles for implementing human attribution in AI systems. It is designed as a foundational reference for developers, researchers, platform providers, and policymakers who aim to align generative AI technologies with human dignity, creative rights, and fair compensation.

The framework supports:

    Ethical recognition of human creators

    Transparent provenance of AI outputs

    Attribution-based micro-royalty systems

    Open standards for metadata, logging, and compensation

This document does not prescribe a single enforcement model, but outlines the minimal structural and technical commitments required to implement attribution meaningfully and at scale.
2. Foundational Principles
2.1 Human-Centricity

AI systems must acknowledge that their capabilities are built on human-generated corpora. Attribution ensures that these systems remain accountable to the individuals whose labor, knowledge, and expression they use.
2.2 Moral and Legal Recognition

Attribution fulfills both moral rights (e.g., the right of paternity) and legal standards (e.g., Berne Convention Art. 6bis). AI systems trained on or influenced by copyrighted material must include provenance metadata when feasible.
2.3 Minimal Ethical Baseline

Attribution is a minimal ethical condition. It does not imply endorsement, ownership, or licensing, but affirms the human contribution that made generative outputs possible.
2.4 Technological Neutrality

This framework is compatible with multiple architectures and modalities (LLMs, diffusion models, retrieval-augmented systems). It is agnostic to programming language or licensing structure.
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Attribution Logging

Models must be capable of recording which training elements or prompts contributed significantly to a given output.

Minimum capabilities:

    Output-level provenance logging

    Probabilistic or approximate source influence scoring

    Storage of attribution logs for auditing and compensation

3.2 Source Tracking

Developers must maintain metadata linking training or fine-tuning data to their original source where applicable. This may include:

    URL, DOI, or creator ID

    Timestamp

    License or rights statement

    Semantic domain (e.g., "fiction prose", "digital painting")

3.3 Influence Scoring

Each generated output must be accompanied by a weighted influence vector indicating top contributors (human or dataset-level).

Techniques may include:

    Embedding similarity scoring

    Influence functions

    Shapley value approximations

    Perturbation or ablation tests

Weights should be normalized to allow proportional compensation or display.
4. Output Requirements
4.1 Attribution Header (Optional Metadata)

Every AI-generated artifact SHOULD contain machine-readable attribution metadata.

Example JSON:
{
  "attribution": [
    {
      "source": "https://example.com/artwork-134",
      "author": "Jane Doe",
      "influence_score": 0.21,
      "license": "CC-BY"
    },
    {
      "source": "Project Gutenberg - Frankenstein",
      "author": "Mary Shelley",
      "influence_score": 0.11,
      "license": "Public Domain"
    }
  ]
}
4.2 End-User Display

For interactive applications, attribution information should be displayed clearly to users, ideally alongside outputs or accessible via metadata toggles or info panels.
4.3 Creator Dashboards (For Registrants)

Systems must support creator-side visibility, including:

    Querying when and how often a work has been used

    Influence scores across outputs

    Revenue from micro-royalties (if enabled)

5. Interoperability and Open Standards
5.1 Attribution Schema (Schema.org Extension or YAML)

All attribution metadata must conform to an open, machine-readable standard. This can be extended from Schema.org, or use custom YAML/JSON schema registries.
5.2 Model Registry Integration

All training datasets and registered works should be mappable via:

    A centralized registry (voluntary or regulated)

    Decentralized content hashes or blockchain-based provenance (optional)

5.3 Provenance APIs

Developers must expose an API endpoint (or internal equivalent) for querying output provenance. This API should accept an output ID and return attribution metadata in JSON format.
6. Compliance and Governance
6.1 Auditability

Attribution logs and metadata should be stored for a minimum period (e.g., 3 years) and made auditable by certified bodies or via public transparency reports.
6.2 Fairness Enforcement

    Systems must prioritize attribution for professional creators with clear rights claims.

    Compensation logic must account for minority, independent, and emergent creators.

    Algorithms must be periodically reviewed for bias in influence estimation.

6.3 Dispute Resolution

Establish open protocols for:

    Attribution challenges

    Weight recalibration

    Misattribution correction

    Arbitration with creator input

7. Extension: Toward Micro-Royalties

While attribution itself does not guarantee payment, it enables:

    Programmatic micro-royalty disbursement per output or use

    Transparent royalty pool allocation

    Payment splitting via smart contracts or traditional registries

Implementation should allow opt-in tiers:

    Attribution-only

    Attribution + notification

    Attribution + compensation

8. Future Directions

    Standardize attribution signal-to-royalty transformation

    Integrate with open licensing marketplaces

    Support differential weighting for novel synthesis vs. direct reproduction

    Enable user-side feedback on attribution accuracy

9. Conclusion

This framework establishes attribution as the minimal viable ethical standard for generative AI. It is not a constraint on innovation but a condition for just participation. By embedding human recognition into model outputs, we sustain the cultural ecosystems that made AI possible in the first place.

All developers, vendors, and institutions building or deploying generative AI systems are invited to adopt and extend this framework under the principle of ethical memory and shared progress.
