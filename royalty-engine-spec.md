Royalty Engine Specification

Version: 1.0
Status: Draft for Review
Author: Attribution Framework Working Group
Date: 2025-06-10
1. Purpose

This specification defines the architecture and operational logic of a micro-royalty distribution engine built to support attribution-based remuneration for human creators whose work has influenced AI outputs. It outlines mechanisms for source tracing, influence quantification, remuneration logic, and governance.

The goal is to establish a scalable, transparent, and minimally intrusive protocol for creators to receive proportionate compensation when their work is used by AI systems — whether for training, fine-tuning, or output generation.
2. Definitions

    Attribution Signal: Metadata associated with an AI output that identifies the influential human-authored sources and quantifies their contribution.

    Influence Score: A normalized weight (∈ [0,1]) representing the estimated proportional contribution of a source to a specific AI output.

    Royalty Unit: The smallest monetary increment payable for a single influence instance (e.g., $0.0001).

    Output Event: A logged generation by an AI system (text, image, code, etc.) intended for use, display, or distribution.

    Creator Registry: A decentralized or federated system that maps digital identifiers to verified creator accounts for routing payments.

4. Functional Modules
4.1 Attribution Logging Layer

    Function: Annotates AI output with inferred source contributions.

    Inputs:

        Prompt + Output Pair

        Model Attention Maps / Embedding Tracebacks

        Training Data Provenance Index

    Outputs:

        Top-N contributor list

        Associated influence scores

        Attribution confidence

Techniques:

    Embedding similarity thresholding

    Shapley value approximations

    Influence functions (Koh & Liang, 2017)

    Data ablation differentials

    Minimum standard: Top 5 contributors with ≥ 2% estimated influence.

4.2 Royalty Allocation Layer

    Function: Maps influence scores to monetary values per output event.

    Configuration:

        Royalty Unit: system-defined (e.g., $0.0001)

        Payout Floor: minimum influence required for any payout (e.g., 1%)

        Weight Normalization: influence scores sum to 1 per output

Formula:

Payout_i = Influence_i × Value_per_output

Where:

    Payout_i = payment to contributor i

    Influence_i = relative contribution of i

    Value_per_output = fixed or tiered royalty unit

4.3 Usage Tracking & Billing Layer

    Modes:

        Per-output use (e.g. API response, content export)

        Aggregate batch (e.g. daily/monthly reports)

    Monetization options:

        End-user pays for content use (B2C)

        AI provider pays licensing tax (B2B)

        Platform-internal credit allocation (freemium)

5. Data Model
Attribution Event

{
  "output_id": "abc123",
  "model_id": "gpt-4o",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-10T13:55:00Z",
  "contributors": [
    {
      "id": "creator_001",
      "name": "Alice Zhang",
      "influence_score": 0.32,
      "confidence": 0.85
    },
    {
      "id": "creator_002",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "influence_score": 0.11,
      "confidence": 0.78
    }
  ],
  "output_value": 0.002
}

6. Prioritization and Fairness Rules

    Verified Creators First: Registered and identity-verified creators receive payment priority.

    Long-Tail Protections: Implement minimum payout guarantees for smaller contributors.

    Weighting Adjustments:

        Boost underrepresented creators (e.g., emerging, non-Western).

        Adjust for data skew (e.g., over-represented styles penalized).

    Opt-In Licensing Pools:

        Premium creators can negotiate higher payout multipliers.

        Open data contributors can waive monetary royalty for symbolic credit.

7. Fraud & Abuse Mitigation

    Anti-Sybil Protocol: Prevent mass creation of fake creator IDs to capture payouts.

    Attribution Audit Logs: Publicly verifiable, tamper-resistant output logs.

    Zero-Knowledge Attribution Proofs (future): Validate influence without exposing full training data.

8. Deployment and Governance

    Initial Deployment:

        Integration into a single AI output platform (e.g., text generation).

        Manual validation of top contributors.

    Governance:

        Attribution Consortium (multi-stakeholder): standards, arbitration, updates.

        Versioning of attribution algorithms and payout policies.

9. API Endpoints (Example)

Payload: { output_id, contributor_list, influence_scores }

GET /payouts/creator/{id}
Returns: list of output events + cumulative royalties

10. Open Questions

    How to attribute content generated from fine-tuned models or derivative datasets?

    Should public domain or commons-licensed works generate symbolic attribution only?

    How to scale this protocol across language models, diffusion models, and music generation?
