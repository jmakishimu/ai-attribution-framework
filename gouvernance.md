Title: Governance Framework for the Attribution and Micro-Royalty Infrastructure
Version: 1.0
Status: Ratified (Subject to PIP Process)
Date: 2025-06-10
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance structure, principles, and decision-making procedures for the Attribution and Micro-Royalty Protocol (“the Protocol”). Its aim is to ensure transparent, inclusive, and enforceable development of the technical, ethical, and legal scaffolds needed to enable fair attribution and compensation for human creative contributions in the age of generative AI.
2. Foundational Principles

All activities under this framework shall be guided by the following principles:

    Human Dignity: Attribution is a matter of moral recognition, not merely metadata.

    Procedural Justice: Changes to the protocol require due process, transparency, and community deliberation.

    Interoperability and Openness: Technical standards must be open, documented, and non-proprietary.

    Pragmatic Feasibility: Governance shall be minimally bureaucratic and scalable across sectors.

    Pluralism and Non-exclusivity: Multiple economic and licensing models (e.g., commons-based, cooperative, royalty-enforced) are valid within the attribution infrastructure.

3. Organizational Roles
3.1. Stewardship Council

The Stewardship Council is the ultimate coordinating body responsible for maintaining the integrity of the Protocol. It holds no commercial or ownership rights.
Composition:

    3 creator representatives (e.g., artists, writers, musicians)

    2 AI/ML developers

    2 legal scholars (intellectual property, international human rights)

    1 representative from public-interest NGOs

    1 platform technologist (infrastructure or protocol design)

Responsibilities:

    Ratify or reject proposed changes to the protocol (PIPs)

    Arbitrate disputes between contributors and implementers

    Approve accreditation of attribution-compliant registries

    Maintain a public changelog and roadmap

    Initiate third-party audits

3.2. Technical Standards Committee (TSC)

This committee proposes and maintains the attribution metadata schemas, API standards, royalty distribution algorithms, and data provenance tracking specifications.
Membership:

Open to contributors with demonstrated competence. Proposals must be endorsed by at least 2 maintainers to enter deliberation.
Authority:

    Maintains /spec/, /schema/, and /scripts/ branches

    Conducts peer review on all protocol-level code and metadata modifications

    Engages with interoperability initiatives (e.g., W3C, Schema.org, SPDX)

3.3. Protocol Improvement Authors (PIP Authors)

Any contributor may propose a Protocol Improvement Proposal (PIP) following the PIP template. A PIP must:

    Clearly define the problem and proposed change

    Justify necessity, feasibility, and backward compatibility

    Include legal, ethical, and technical review

    Undergo at least 2 rounds of public commentary

PIPs are numbered and stored in /pips/. Once finalized, a PIP may be escalated to the Stewardship Council for ratification.
4. Decision-Making Process
4.1. PIP Lifecycle

    Draft: Author submits a proposal to /pips/ via Git PR.

    Review: Open commentary period (minimum 21 days).

    Deliberation: TSC and Council designate reviewers.

    Revision: Author integrates feedback.

    Vote: Council votes (2/3 majority required).

    Outcome: Merged into main if approved; archived if rejected with rationale.

4.2. Dispute Resolution
Domains:

    Attribution disputes (e.g., incorrect influence mapping)

    Royalty allocation complaints

    Licensing incompatibilities

Mechanism:

    Submit issue to /governance/disputes/

    Triaged by Dispute Committee (ad hoc, drawn from Council)

    If unresolved, submit to independent arbitration partner (e.g., Creative Commons, WIPO)

Appeals require new evidence and must be filed within 60 days of resolution.
5. Public Accountability

    Audit Logs: All attribution logs, royalty distributions, and codebase changes must be time-stamped, version-controlled, and publicly visible.

    Transparency Reports: Quarterly disclosures of:

        Number of AI outputs with attribution enabled

        Top contributors by attribution score

        Royalty distributions (aggregated and anonymized unless opted-in)

    Conflict of Interest Disclosures: All Council members must declare financial or professional affiliations.

6. Implementation Norms
6.1. Attribution Fidelity Requirements

Implementers must:

    Log attribution metadata per the defined schema

    Include attribution in output UIs (tooltips, citations, credits)

    Expose source contributions via an open API endpoint

    Maintain compatibility with registered attribution registries

Non-compliance may result in delisting from protocol-compliant status.
6.2. Registry Accreditation

To be recognized as a trusted attribution registry, an entity must:

    Provide verifiable identity resolution for creators

    Support opt-in licensing (including attribution clauses)

    Offer programmatic APIs for lookup and logging

    Undergo a yearly compliance audit

7. Amendments to Governance

Amendments to this governance model require:

    Submission of PIP with “Governance” label

    Public commentary (minimum 30 days)

    3/4 supermajority vote from the Stewardship Council

    Ratification announcement with changelog

Emergency amendments (e.g., security threats) may be provisionally applied by a 4/5 Council vote but must be ratified within 60 days or expire.
8. Licensing and Jurisdiction

    All governance documents are released under CC BY-SA 4.0.

    The Protocol is jurisdiction-neutral, but aligned with Berne Convention principles and compatible with GDPR, CCPA, and other data/creative rights regimes.

    Legal interpretation defaults to public interest and creator-centric intent.

9. Sunset Clause and Continuity

If the Stewardship Council is dissolved, the governance rights and responsibilities shall pass to an open-source foundation or cooperative elected by active contributors (≥100 in past 12 months), using a one-creator-one-vote principle.
